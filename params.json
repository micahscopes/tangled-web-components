[See for yourself...](examples)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n##### Try the examples locally:\r\n```bash\r\n% npm -g install superstatic\r\n% superstatic\r\n```\r\nThen open the browser to `http://localhost:3474/examples/`.\r\n\r\n##### Compile:\r\n```bash\r\n% npm install\r\n% npm run build\r\n```\r\n## Examples\r\nA dog on a scooter.\r\n```html\r\n<puppy-dog></puppy-dog>\r\n```\r\nThree dogs on scooters in a totally connected graph:\r\n```html\r\n<graph-container>\r\n  <edges-all-pairs></edges-all-pairs>\r\n  <puppy-dog></puppy-dog>\r\n  <puppy-dog></puppy-dog>\r\n  <puppy-dog></puppy-dog>\r\n</graph-container>\r\n```\r\nUsing an adjacency matrix to define the edges.\r\n```html\r\n<graph-container>\r\n  <edges-adjacency-matrix>\r\n    [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,0,0]]\r\n  </edges-adjacency-matrix>\r\n  <div>reduce</div>\r\n  <div>reuse</div>\r\n  <div>recyle</div>\r\n</graph-container>\r\n```\r\nThe `handle-box` element makes its contents draggable:\r\n```html\r\n<graph-container>\r\n  <handle-box>\r\n    <h1>grab this</h1>\r\n  </handle-box>\r\n  <handle-box>\r\n    <h1>grab this</h1>\r\n  </handle-box>\r\n<edges-all-pairs></edges-all-pairs>\r\n</graph-container>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOkay!
